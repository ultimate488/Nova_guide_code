    A dedicated, isolated process for handling all text-to-speech requests.

    1. gTTS: Converts text to a high-quality MP3 file.
    2. playsound: Plays the generated audio file.
    This architecture is extremely reliable and avoids the common pitfalls of
    using complex TTS engines directly inside a child process.
